To display student information such as Name, Roll No, Mobile No, and Email ID using Django, you need to create a Django web application with a model to represent the student information and a view to display it. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Create a Django Project and App:**

   If you haven't already created a Django project and app, you can do so by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject studentinfo_project
   cd studentinfo_project
   python manage.py startapp studentinfo
   ```

2. **Define the Model:**

   In the `studentinfo` app, define a model to represent the student information. Open the `models.py` file in the `studentinfo` directory and create the model:

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Student(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       roll_no = models.CharField(max_length=20)
       mobile_no = models.CharField(max_length=15)
       email = models.EmailField(max_length=100)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name
   ```

3. **Migrate the Database:**

   Apply the initial migrations to create the database table for your `Student` model:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create the View:**

   Create a view to fetch and display student information. In your `views.py`:

   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .models import Student

   def student_list(request):
       students = Student.objects.all()
       return render(request, 'studentinfo/student_list.html', {'students': students})
   ```

5. **Create URL Patterns:**

   Define a URL pattern to route requests to the `student_list` view. In your `urls.py`:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('students/', views.student_list, name='student_list'),
   ]
   ```

6. **Create the Template:**

   Create an HTML template to display the student information. Place this template in a `templates` directory within your `studentinfo` app directory.

   - `studentinfo/templates/studentinfo/student_list.html`:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>Student Information</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Student Information</h1>
         <table>
             <tr>
                 <th>Name</th>
                 <th>Roll No</th>
                 <th>Mobile No</th>
                 <th>Email</th>
             </tr>
             {% for student in students %}
             <tr>
                 <td>{{ student.name }}</td>
                 <td>{{ student.roll_no }}</td>
                 <td>{{ student.mobile_no }}</td>
                 <td>{{ student.email }}</td>
             </tr>
             {% endfor %}
         </table>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

7. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Your student information page should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/students/`, displaying the student information from the database.

This is a basic implementation of a web page to display student information using Django. You can expand and enhance it by adding features like student registration, user authentication, and better styling. Additionally, consider deploying your app to a production server when you're ready to share it with others.
